# Hangman
Continuing my python tutorial, I'm writing up a hangman game.  
The final goal is to be able to input a text file and
scan it to build a dictionary of words.  
When the game is started up, a random word will be chosen and the game can commence
in single player mode.

New information being thrown in just for fun
